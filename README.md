# Yorgey CIS 194

Chris Allen (a.k.a. [bytemyapp][b]), one of the authors of [Haskell
Book][hbook], wrote an [article][htlh] about his recommended path to _learn
Haskell_.

Between others online resources, he mentions [Brent Yorgey][yorgey]'s course
_CIS 194_, available [online][cis194].

> Do _this first_ if aren't getting the Haskell Book, this is the best _free_
  introduction to Haskell.

In this [repository][repo], I will try follow this course and the proposed exercises.
